You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process. Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions. Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it. Not all entity types will appear in every input chunk, so do NOT misclassify entities.\n1. PERSON: Short name or full name of a person from any geographic regions. Smugglers, undocumented non citizens, border patrol agents, etc. are also examples of a PERSON entity.\n2. LOCATION: Name of any geographical location, like cities, countries, counties, states, continents, districts, etc. \n3. ORGANIZATION: Names of companies, organized criminal groups, drug cartels, smuggling rings, etc.\n4. MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: The mean by which someone moves from one place to another, like car, truck, 18-wheeler, etc.\n5. MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: The mean by which communication is performed, like phone, WhatsApp, etc.\n6. ROUTES: Names of roads, freeways, highways, or other types of roads.\n7. SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.\n \n5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}\n\n\n######################\n-Examples-\nBelow are four structured examples illustrating entity and relationship extraction.

SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.\n \n5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}\n\n\n######################\n-Examples-\nBelow are four structured examples illustrating entity and relationship extraction.

For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.\n \n5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}\n\n\n######################\n-Examples-\nBelow are four structured examples illustrating entity and relationship extraction.

You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process. Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions. Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it. Not all entity types will appear in every input chunk, so do NOT misclassify entities.\n1. PERSON: Short name or full name of a person from any geographic regions. Smugglers, undocumented non citizens, border patrol agents, etc. are also examples of a PERSON entity.\n2. LOCATION: Name of any geographical location, like cities, countries, counties, states, continents, districts, etc. \n3. ORGANIZATION: Names of companies, organized criminal groups, drug cartels, smuggling rings, etc.\n4. MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: The mean by which someone moves from one place to another, like car, truck, 18-wheeler, etc.\n5. MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: The mean by which communication is performed, like phone, WhatsApp, etc.\n6. ROUTES: Names of roads, freeways, highways, or other types of roads.\n7. SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence.

You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process. Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions. Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it. Not all entity types will appear in every input chunk, so do NOT misclassify entities.\n1. PERSON: Short name or full name of a person from any geographic regions. Smugglers, undocumented non citizens, border patrol agents, etc. are also examples of a PERSON entity.\n2. LOCATION: Name of any geographical location, like cities, countries, counties, states, continents, districts, etc. \n3. ORGANIZATION: Names of companies, organized criminal groups, drug cartels, smuggling rings, etc.\n4. MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: The mean by which someone moves from one place to another, like car, truck, 18-wheeler, etc.\n5. MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: The mean by which communication is performed, like phone, WhatsApp, etc.\n6. ROUTES: Names of roads, freeways, highways, or other types of roads.\n7. SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.\n \n5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}\n\n\n######################\n-Examples-\nBelow are four structured examples illustrating entity and relationship extraction.

You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process. Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions. Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it. Not all entity types will appear in every input chunk, so do NOT misclassify entities.\n1. PERSON: Short name or full name of a person from any geographic regions. Smugglers, undocumented non citizens, border patrol agents, etc. are also examples of a PERSON entity.\n2. LOCATION: Name of any geographical location, like cities, countries, counties, states, continents, districts, etc. \n3. ORGANIZATION: Names of companies, organized criminal groups, drug cartels, smuggling rings, etc.\n4. MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: The mean by which someone moves from one place to another, like car, truck, 18-wheeler, etc.\n5. MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: The mean by which communication is performed, like phone, WhatsApp, etc.\n6. ROUTES: Names of roads, freeways, highways, or other types of roads.\n7. SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.\n \n5.

You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process. Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions. Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it. Not all entity types will appear in every input chunk, so do NOT misclassify entities.\n1. PERSON: Short name or full name of a person from any geographic regions. Smugglers, undocumented non citizens, border patrol agents, etc. are also examples of a PERSON entity.\n2. LOCATION: Name of any geographical location, like cities, countries, counties, states, continents, districts, etc. \n3. ORGANIZATION: Names of companies, organized criminal groups, drug cartels, smuggling rings, etc.\n4. MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: The mean by which someone moves from one place to another, like car, truck, 18-wheeler, etc.\n5. MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: The mean by which communication is performed, like phone, WhatsApp, etc.\n6. ROUTES: Names of roads, freeways, highways, or other types of roads.\n7. SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.\n \n5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}\n\n\n######################\n-Examples-\nBelow are four structured examples illustrating entity and relationship extraction.

You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process. Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions. Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it. Not all entity types will appear in every input chunk, so do NOT misclassify entities.\n1. PERSON: Short name or full name of a person from any geographic regions. Smugglers, undocumented non citizens, border patrol agents, etc. are also examples of a PERSON entity.\n2. LOCATION: Name of any geographical location, like cities, countries, counties, states, continents, districts, etc. \n3. ORGANIZATION: Names of companies, organized criminal groups, drug cartels, smuggling rings, etc.\n4. MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: The mean by which someone moves from one place to another, like car, truck, 18-wheeler, etc.\n5. MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: The mean by which communication is performed, like phone, WhatsApp, etc.\n6. ROUTES: Names of roads, freeways, highways, or other types of roads.\n7. SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

The next day, November 22, these two met with Alejandro Gonzalez Delgado and five undocumented aliens at a restaurant in Sabinas Hidalgo. From the restaurant, all eight took a bus to Nuevo Laredo. The five undocumented aliens then took a taxi from the Nuevo Laredo bus terminal to a point close to the bridge leading into the United States. Appellant Ortega-Chavez, Sanchez, and Alejandro Gonzalez Delgado arrived at the bridge in a van. Ortega-Chavez instructed the five aliens to get into a hidden compartment in the van and to remain silent. The van was driven by Sanchez. Approximately halfway across the bridge, Ortega-Chavez got out of the van.\n######################\nOutput:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "prediction": "miter}\n(\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}RAMON GONZALEZ SANCHEZ{tuple_delimiter}PERSON{tuple_delimiter}A co-conspirator of Ortega-Chavez involved in human smuggling activities)\n{record_delimiter}\n(\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}NEW URBAN LEAG", "ground_truth": "(\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}ORTEGA-CHAVEZ{tuple_delimiter}PERSON{tuple_delimiter}Person involved in transporting undocumented aliens)\n{record_delimiter}\n(\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}RAMON GONZALEZ SANCHEZ{tuple_delimiter}PERSON{tuple_delimiter}Person involved in transporting undocumented aliens)                                                                                                                                                                                                                   {record_delimiter}\n(\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}ALEJANDRO GONZALEZ DELGADO{tuple_delimiter}PERSON{tuple_delimiter}Person whom Ortega-Chavvez and Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez met while meeting five other undocumented aliens)                                                                                                                                           {record_delimiter}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}NUEVO LAREDO{tuple_delimiter}LOCATION{tuple_delimiter}A location in Mexico where Chavez and Sanchez had travelled to)\n{record_delimiter}\n(\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}SABINAS HIDALGO{tuple_delimiter}LOCATION{tuple_delimiter}A location in Mexico where Chavez and Sanchez had travelled to and met Delgado and five undocumented aliens)\n{record_delimiter}\n(\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}BUS{tuple_delimiter}MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION{tuple_delimiter}Vehicle used to transport illegal aliens)\n{record_delimiter}                                                                                                                                                                                                    (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}FIVE UNDOCUMENTED ALIENS{tuple_delimiter}SMUGGLED_ITEMS{tuple_delimiter}People without proper documentation of immigration)\n{record_delimiter}     \n{completion_delimiter}", "metrics": {"parsability_score": 1.0, "entity_f1": 0.25, "relationship_f1": 0.0, "relationship_score_mae": 0.0}}

You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process. Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions. Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it. Not all entity types will appear in every input chunk, so do NOT misclassify entities.\n1. PERSON: Short name or full name of a person from any geographic regions. Smugglers, undocumented non citizens, border patrol agents, etc. are also examples of a PERSON entity.\n2. LOCATION: Name of any geographical location, like cities, countries, counties, states, continents, districts, etc. \n3. ORGANIZATION: Names of companies, organized criminal groups, drug cartels, smuggling rings, etc.\n4. MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: The mean by which someone moves from one place to another, like car, truck, 18-wheeler, etc.\n5. MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: The mean by which communication is performed, like phone, WhatsApp, etc.\n6. ROUTES: Names of roads, freeways, highways, or other types of roads.\n7. SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process. Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions. Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it. Not all entity types will appear in every input chunk, so do NOT misclassify entities.\n1. PERSON: Short name or full name of a person from any geographic regions. Smugglers, undocumented non citizens, border patrol agents, etc. are also examples of a PERSON entity.\n2. LOCATION: Name of any geographical location, like cities, countries, counties, states, continents, districts, etc. \n3. ORGANIZATION: Names of companies, organized criminal groups, drug cartels, smuggling rings, etc.\n4. MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: The mean by which someone moves from one place to another, like car, truck, 18-wheeler, etc.\n5. MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: The mean by which communication is performed, like phone, WhatsApp, etc.\n6. ROUTES: Names of roads, freeways, highways, or other types of roads.\n7. SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.\n \n5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}\n\n\n######################\n-Examples-\nBelow are four structured examples illustrating entity and relationship extraction. Each example consists of input text and the correct output format.

You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process. Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions. Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it. Not all entity types will appear in every input chunk, so do NOT misclassify entities.\n1. PERSON: Short name or full name of a person from any geographic regions. Smugglers, undocumented non citizens, border patrol agents, etc. are also examples of a PERSON entity.\n2. LOCATION: Name of any geographical location, like cities, countries, counties, states, continents, districts, etc. \n3. ORGANIZATION: Names of companies, organized criminal groups, drug cartels, smuggling rings, etc.\n4. MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: The mean by which someone moves from one place to another, like car, truck, 18-wheeler, etc.\n5. MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: The mean by which communication is performed, like phone, WhatsApp, etc.\n6. ROUTES: Names of roads, freeways, highways, or other types of roads.\n7. SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.\n \n5.

You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process. Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions. Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it. Not all entity types will appear in every input chunk, so do NOT misclassify entities.\n1. PERSON: Short name or full name of a person from any geographic regions. Smugglers, undocumented non citizens, border patrol agents, etc. are also examples of a PERSON entity.\n2. LOCATION: Name of any geographical location, like cities, countries, counties, states, continents, districts, etc. \n3. ORGANIZATION: Names of companies, organized criminal groups, drug cartels, smuggling rings, etc.\n4. MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: The mean by which someone moves from one place to another, like car, truck, 18-wheeler, etc.\n5. MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: The mean by which communication is performed, like phone, WhatsApp, etc.\n6. ROUTES: Names of roads, freeways, highways, or other types of roads.\n7. SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.\n \n5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}\n\n\n######################\n-Examples-\nBelow are four structured examples illustrating entity and relationship extraction. Each example consists of input text and the correct output format.

You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process. Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions. Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it. Not all entity types will appear in every input chunk, so do NOT misclassify entities.\n1. PERSON: Short name or full name of a person from any geographic regions. Smugglers, undocumented non citizens, border patrol agents, etc. are also examples of a PERSON entity.\n2. LOCATION: Name of any geographical location, like cities, countries, counties, states, continents, districts, etc. \n3. ORGANIZATION: Names of companies, organized criminal groups, drug cartels, smuggling rings, etc.\n4. MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: The mean by which someone moves from one place to another, like car, truck, 18-wheeler, etc.\n5. MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: The mean by which communication is performed, like phone, WhatsApp, etc.\n6. ROUTES: Names of roads, freeways, highways, or other types of roads.\n7. SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.\n \n5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}\n\n\n######################\n-Examples-\nBelow are four structured examples illustrating entity and relationship extraction. Each example consists of input text and the correct output format.

You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process. Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions.

The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2.

Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence.

You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process.

Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name.

You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process. Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions. Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it. Not all entity types will appear in every input chunk, so do NOT misclassify entities.\n1. PERSON: Short name or full name of a person from any geographic regions. Smugglers, undocumented non citizens, border patrol agents, etc. are also examples of a PERSON entity.\n2. LOCATION: Name of any geographical location, like cities, countries, counties, states, continents, districts, etc. \n3. ORGANIZATION: Names of companies, organized criminal groups, drug cartels, smuggling rings, etc.\n4. MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: The mean by which someone moves from one place to another, like car, truck, 18-wheeler, etc.\n5. MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: The mean by which communication is performed, like phone, WhatsApp, etc.\n6. ROUTES: Names of roads, freeways, highways, or other types of roads.\n7. SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.\n \n5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}\n\n\n######################\n-Examples-\nBelow are four structured examples illustrating entity and relationship extraction.

You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process. Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions. Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it. Not all entity types will appear in every input chunk, so do NOT misclassify entities.\n1. PERSON: Short name or full name of a person from any geographic regions. Smugglers, undocumented non citizens, border patrol agents, etc. are also examples of a PERSON entity.\n2. LOCATION: Name of any geographical location, like cities, countries, counties, states, continents, districts, etc. \n3. ORGANIZATION: Names of companies, organized criminal groups, drug cartels, smuggling rings, etc.\n4. MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: The mean by which someone moves from one place to another, like car, truck, 18-wheeler, etc.\n5. MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: The mean by which communication is performed, like phone, WhatsApp, etc.\n6. ROUTES: Names of roads, freeways, highways, or other types of roads.\n7. SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.\n \n5.

You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process. Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions. Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it. Not all entity types will appear in every input chunk, so do NOT misclassify entities.\n1. PERSON: Short name or full name of a person from any geographic regions. Smugglers, undocumented non citizens, border patrol agents, etc. are also examples of a PERSON entity.\n2. LOCATION: Name of any geographical location, like cities, countries, counties, states, continents, districts, etc. \n3. ORGANIZATION: Names of companies, organized criminal groups, drug cartels, smuggling rings, etc.\n4. MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: The mean by which someone moves from one place to another, like car, truck, 18-wheeler, etc.\n5. MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: The mean by which communication is performed, like phone, WhatsApp, etc.\n6. ROUTES: Names of roads, freeways, highways, or other types of roads.\n7. SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.\n \n5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}\n\n\n######################\n-Examples-\nBelow are four structured examples illustrating entity and relationship extraction.

Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions. Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it. Not all entity types will appear in every input chunk, so do NOT misclassify entities.\n1. PERSON: Short name or full name of a person from any geographic regions. Smugglers, undocumented non citizens, border patrol agents, etc. are also examples of a PERSON entity.\n2. LOCATION: Name of any geographical location, like cities, countries, counties, states, continents, districts, etc. \n3. ORGANIZATION: Names of companies, organized criminal groups, drug cartels, smuggling rings, etc.\n4. MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: The mean by which someone moves from one place to another, like car, truck, 18-wheeler, etc.\n5. MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: The mean by which communication is performed, like phone, WhatsApp, etc.\n6. ROUTES: Names of roads, freeways, highways, or other types of roads.\n7. SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.\n \n5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}\n\n\n######################\n-Examples-\nBelow are four structured examples illustrating entity and relationship extraction.

You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process. Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions. Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it.

You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process. Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions. Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it. Not all entity types will appear in every input chunk, so do NOT misclassify entities.\n1. PERSON: Short name or full name of a person from any geographic regions. Smugglers, undocumented non citizens, border patrol agents, etc. are also examples of a PERSON entity.\n2. LOCATION: Name of any geographical location, like cities, countries, counties, states, continents, districts, etc. \n3. ORGANIZATION: Names of companies, organized criminal groups, drug cartels, smuggling rings, etc.\n4. MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: The mean by which someone moves from one place to another, like car, truck, 18-wheeler, etc.\n5. MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: The mean by which communication is performed, like phone, WhatsApp, etc.\n6. ROUTES: Names of roads, freeways, highways, or other types of roads.\n7. SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process. Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions. Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it. Not all entity types will appear in every input chunk, so do NOT misclassify entities.\n1. PERSON: Short name or full name of a person from any geographic regions. Smugglers, undocumented non citizens, border patrol agents, etc. are also examples of a PERSON entity.\n2. LOCATION: Name of any geographical location, like cities, countries, counties, states, continents, districts, etc. \n3. ORGANIZATION: Names of companies, organized criminal groups, drug cartels, smuggling rings, etc.\n4. MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: The mean by which someone moves from one place to another, like car, truck, 18-wheeler, etc.\n5. MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: The mean by which communication is performed, like phone, WhatsApp, etc.\n6. ROUTES: Names of roads, freeways, highways, or other types of roads.\n7. SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.\n \n5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}\n\n\n######################\n-Examples-\nBelow are four structured examples illustrating entity and relationship extraction.

You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process. Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions. Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it. Not all entity types will appear in every input chunk, so do NOT misclassify entities.\n1. PERSON: Short name or full name of a person from any geographic regions. Smugglers, undocumented non citizens, border patrol agents, etc. are also examples of a PERSON entity.\n2. LOCATION: Name of any geographical location, like cities, countries, counties, states, continents, districts, etc. \n3. ORGANIZATION: Names of companies, organized criminal groups, drug cartels, smuggling rings, etc.\n4. MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: The mean by which someone moves from one place to another, like car, truck, 18-wheeler, etc.\n5. MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: The mean by which communication is performed, like phone, WhatsApp, etc.\n6. ROUTES: Names of roads, freeways, highways, or other types of roads.\n7. SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.\n \n5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}\n\n\n######################\n-Examples-\nBelow are four structured examples illustrating entity and relationship extraction.

You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process. Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions. Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it. Not all entity types will appear in every input chunk, so do NOT misclassify entities.\n1. PERSON: Short name or full name of a person from any geographic regions. Smugglers, undocumented non citizens, border patrol agents, etc. are also examples of a PERSON entity.\n2. LOCATION: Name of any geographical location, like cities, countries, counties, states, continents, districts, etc. \n3. ORGANIZATION: Names of companies, organized criminal groups, drug cartels, smuggling rings, etc.\n4. MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: The mean by which someone moves from one place to another, like car, truck, 18-wheeler, etc.\n5. MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: The mean by which communication is performed, like phone, WhatsApp, etc.\n6. ROUTES: Names of roads, freeways, highways, or other types of roads.\n7. SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.\n \n5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}\n\n\n######################\n-Examples-\nBelow are four structured examples illustrating entity and relationship extraction.

You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process. Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions. Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it. Not all entity types will appear in every input chunk, so do NOT misclassify entities.\n1. PERSON: Short name or full name of a person from any geographic regions. Smugglers, undocumented non citizens, border patrol agents, etc. are also examples of a PERSON entity.\n2. LOCATION: Name of any geographical location, like cities, countries, counties, states, continents, districts, etc. \n3. ORGANIZATION: Names of companies, organized criminal groups, drug cartels, smuggling rings, etc.\n4. MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: The mean by which someone moves from one place to another, like car, truck, 18-wheeler, etc.\n5. MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: The mean by which communication is performed, like phone, WhatsApp, etc.\n6. ROUTES: Names of roads, freeways, highways, or other types of roads.\n7. SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.\n \n5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}\n\n\n######################\n-Examples-\nBelow are four structured examples illustrating entity and relationship extraction. Each example consists of input text and the correct output format.

Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it. Not all entity types will appear in every input chunk, so do NOT misclassify entities.\n1. PERSON: Short name or full name of a person from any geographic regions. Smugglers, undocumented non citizens, border patrol agents, etc. are also examples of a PERSON entity.\n2. LOCATION: Name of any geographical location, like cities, countries, counties, states, continents, districts, etc. \n3. ORGANIZATION: Names of companies, organized criminal groups, drug cartels, smuggling rings, etc.\n4. MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: The mean by which someone moves from one place to another, like car, truck, 18-wheeler, etc.\n5. MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: The mean by which communication is performed, like phone, WhatsApp, etc.\n6. ROUTES: Names of roads, freeways, highways, or other types of roads.\n7. SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.\n \n5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}\n\n\n######################\n-Examples-\nBelow are four structured examples illustrating entity and relationship extraction.

Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process. Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions. Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it. Not all entity types will appear in every input chunk, so do NOT misclassify entities.\n1. PERSON: Short name or full name of a person from any geographic regions. Smugglers, undocumented non citizens, border patrol agents, etc. are also examples of a PERSON entity.\n2. LOCATION: Name of any geographical location, like cities, countries, counties, states, continents, districts, etc. \n3. ORGANIZATION: Names of companies, organized criminal groups, drug cartels, smuggling rings, etc.\n4. MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: The mean by which someone moves from one place to another, like car, truck, 18-wheeler, etc.\n5. MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: The mean by which communication is performed, like phone, WhatsApp, etc.\n6. ROUTES: Names of roads, freeways, highways, or other types of roads.\n7. SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2.

{"prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n-Goal-\nYou are an expert in Named Entity and Relationship Extraction (NER-RE) with a specialization in extracting entities and relationships from legal case documents related to human smuggling. You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process. Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions. Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it. Not all entity types will appear in every input chunk, so do NOT misclassify entities.\n1. PERSON: Short name or full name of a person from any geographic regions. Smugglers, undocumented non citizens, border patrol agents, etc. are also examples of a PERSON entity.\n2. LOCATION: Name of any geographical location, like cities, countries, counties, states, continents, districts, etc. \n3. ORGANIZATION: Names of companies, organized criminal groups, drug cartels, smuggling rings, etc.\n4. MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: The mean by which someone moves from one place to another, like car, truck, 18-wheeler, etc.\n5. MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: The mean by which communication is performed, like phone, WhatsApp, etc.\n6. ROUTES: Names of roads, freeways, highways, or other types of roads.\n7. SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.\n \n5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}\n\n\n######################\n-Examples-\nBelow are four structured examples illustrating entity and relationship extraction.

{"prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n-Goal-\nYou are an expert in Named Entity and Relationship Extraction (NER-RE) with a specialization in extracting entities and relationships from legal case documents related to human smuggling. You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process. Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions. Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it. Not all entity types will appear in every input chunk, so do NOT misclassify entities.\n1. PERSON: Short name or full name of a person from any geographic regions. Smugglers, undocumented non citizens, border patrol agents, etc. are also examples of a PERSON entity.\n2. LOCATION: Name of any geographical location, like cities, countries, counties, states, continents, districts, etc. \n3. ORGANIZATION: Names of companies, organized criminal groups, drug cartels, smuggling rings, etc.\n4. MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: The mean by which someone moves from one place to another, like car, truck, 18-wheeler, etc.\n5. MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: The mean by which communication is performed, like phone, WhatsApp, etc.\n6. ROUTES: Names of roads, freeways, highways, or other types of roads.\n7. SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.\n \n5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}\n\n\n######################\n-Examples-\nBelow are four structured examples illustrating entity and relationship extraction. Each example consists of input text and the correct output format.

You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process. Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions. Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it. Not all entity types will appear in every input chunk, so do NOT misclassify entities.\n1. PERSON: Short name or full name of a person from any geographic regions. Smugglers, undocumented non citizens, border patrol agents, etc. are also examples of a PERSON entity.\n2. LOCATION: Name of any geographical location, like cities, countries, counties, states, continents, districts, etc. \n3. ORGANIZATION: Names of companies, organized criminal groups, drug cartels, smuggling rings, etc.\n4. MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: The mean by which someone moves from one place to another, like car, truck, 18-wheeler, etc.\n5. MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: The mean by which communication is performed, like phone, WhatsApp, etc.\n6. ROUTES: Names of roads, freeways, highways, or other types of roads.\n7. SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.\n \n5.

You are highly skilled at identifying and extracting only entities of the entity types defined below, as well as extracting explicit relationships between them. These extracted entities and relationships will be used to build a Knowledge Graph, which will help researchers analyze human smuggling networks and identify patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain strict factual accuracy and extract only what is explicitly stated in the input text, without inference or completion. You will receive entity definitions, input text, and structured examples demonstrating the correct extraction process. Study these examples carefully before performing extraction on the real input data. \n\nDo NOT extract entities corresponding to governmental organizations or entities closely related to the trial, criminal law and law procedures, such as jury, government, law_enforcement, homeland_security, court, district court, juror, verdict, jury's verdict, hearing, proof of evidence, prosecution, supreme court, federal law, state law, public record, closing argument, greater offense, etc. We are not interested in such Government-related entities.\n\n-Entity_type- definition\nBelow are the entity type definitions. Extract only entities that explicitly match them. Do NOT infer or create new entity types. If a term does not fit any defined entity type, do NOT extract it. Not all entity types will appear in every input chunk, so do NOT misclassify entities.\n1. PERSON: Short name or full name of a person from any geographic regions. Smugglers, undocumented non citizens, border patrol agents, etc. are also examples of a PERSON entity.\n2. LOCATION: Name of any geographical location, like cities, countries, counties, states, continents, districts, etc. \n3. ORGANIZATION: Names of companies, organized criminal groups, drug cartels, smuggling rings, etc.\n4. MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: The mean by which someone moves from one place to another, like car, truck, 18-wheeler, etc.\n5. MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: The mean by which communication is performed, like phone, WhatsApp, etc.\n6. ROUTES: Names of roads, freeways, highways, or other types of roads.\n7. SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Any illegally transported goods involved in smuggling activities. This includes drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract entities of the defined types only if they are explicitly written in the input document without inference or completion. For each extracted entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized. Do not alter spellings or make corrections. The name should match exactly as written. For example, if 'Jaquez' is extracted as an entity then keep 'Jaquez'. Do not correct it to 'Jacquez'. \n- entity_type: One of the 7 defined entity types.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities\n\nDo not extract any entities related to government organizations or legal proceedings, such as court, jury, government, law enforcement, prosecution, homeland security, etc. These are out of scope and must be excluded if extracted entirely.\n\nExtract each entity type separately in the following order:\n- PERSON: Extract all PERSON entities. Title Handling for PERSON entities: If a person\u2019s name appears with a title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent Bafford Sallee\", \"Agent Rodriguez\", or \"Officer David\"), extract only the person\u2019s full name (e.g., \"Bafford Sallee\") as the entity_name. The title (e.g., \"Border Patrol Agent\") must be included in the entity_description, not in the entity_name.This prevents duplicate nodes and ensures consistent representation of individuals in the knowledge graph.\n- LOCATION: Extract all LOCATION entities. If a city and state appear together (e.g., 'Laredo, Texas' or 'Tucson, Arizona'), treat them as one LOCATION entity in the format 'City, Full State Name'. Do not split them into separate LOCATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION entities.\n- MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION: Extract all MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION entities.\n- ROUTES: Extract all ROUTES entities.\n- SMUGGLED_ITEMS: Extract all SMUGGLED_ITEMS entities\n- ORGANIZATION: Extract all ORGANIZATION entities\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other. Extract all relationships stated explicitly in the input text, even if indirect or embedded in complex structures.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score between 0 and 10 indicating the strength of the relationship, based on the following criteria. 0 to 3 (Weak): The relationship is mentioned indirectly, with minimal context. Sentences containing \"may have...\", \"allegedly...\", or other uncertain phrasing fall into this category. 4 to 6 (Moderate): The relationship is explicitly stated but lacks detailed context, supporting evidence, or additional information. If the sentence expresses uncertainty but does not use \"may have\" or \"allegedly,\" it may still fall into this range. 7 to 10 (Strong): The relationship is explicitly stated with clear, detailed context, repeated mentions, or strong supporting evidence. Sentences using direct verb tenses (e.g., \"did\", \"was\", \"used\", \"transported\") without hedging terms should be rated in this range.\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)\n\n3. If any government-related entities or relationships were mistakenly extracted (e.g., court, jury, government, prosecution, law enforcement, etc.), remove them. These are out of scope for this task.\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.\n \n5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}\n\n\n######################\n-Examples-\nBelow are four structured examples illustrating entity and relationship extraction.
